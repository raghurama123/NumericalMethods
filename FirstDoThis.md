As much as possible, the Numerical Methods course at TIFR Hyderabad will happen in an online mode. So, this document lists out the very first steps for the students participating in the course.

## Things you need to get started

First of all, make sure that you have access to a laptop or a desktop. For those with Windows OS, please make sure that you get a virtual environment with Linux in it. While this is not very critical, most students use Linux so it will be easy for you to learn from each other's experience. 

Install Python3 and the libraries `numpy` and `matplotlib`. You may need other libraries like `scipy` and `pandas` at a later stage, but by then you'll have gained a lot of experience with Python so you'll know what to do.

Install Jupyter to access the notebooks.

Please do not hesitate to take help from your batch mates or senior students at the institute.
