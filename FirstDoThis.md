This document lists out the steps students participating in the Numerical Methods course must do in order to successfully make a copy of the materials made available in this repository. 

## Get a laptop or a desktop

First of all, make sure that you have access to a laptop or a desktop. For those with Windows OS, please make sure that you get a virtual environment with Linux in it. While this is not very critical, most students use Linux so it will be easy for you to learn from each other's experience. 

Install Python3 and the libraries numpy and matplotlib. You may need other libraries like scipy and pandas at a later stage, but by then you'll have gained a lot of experience with Python so you'll know what to do.
